        <h2>Unstuffed Cabbage Roll</h2>
        <p>This is an easy casserole made with ground beef, cabbage, garlic, and tomatoes. My kids don't even like cabbage, but they love this dish! Serve with rice for a comforting weeknight dinner. Also, the longer it stands the better it tastes!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small head cabbage, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
